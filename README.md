# The Monitor  

## Introduction  
The Monitor is a simple device designed to track your pulse and movement. It uses sensors to measure your heart rate and activity levels, making it useful for fitness enthusiasts or anyone looking to monitor their health. This project combines basic robotics and sensor technology to create a practical and easy-to-use solution.  

## General Description  
The Monitor integrates lightweight hardware with user-friendly software to monitor and record pulse and movement data. The device uses a pulse sensor and an accelerometer to collect real-time information, which is processed and displayed through an intuitive interface. It is designed to be portable, reliable, and easy to use for everyday applications.  

## Hardware Design  
The hardware for The Monitor includes the following components:  
- **Pulse Sensor**: Detects heart rate by measuring blood flow through the skin.  
- **Accelerometer**: Measures movement and activity levels.  
- **Microcontroller**: Processes data from the sensors and sends it to a display or storage device.  
- **Power Source**: A lightweight battery for portability and convenience.
- **More Components

These components are assembled on a small circuit board to ensure the device is compact, wearable, and comfortable.  

## Software Design  
The software processes data from the sensors and presents it to the user. Key aspects include:  
- **Data Collection**: Reads real-time data from the sensors.  
- **Processing**: Filters out noise and calculates metrics like heart rate and activity levels.  
- **User Interface**: Displays the data in an easy-to-understand format through a screen or a connected application.  

The software will be developed using the Arduino IDE, leveraging libraries for the pulse sensor and accelerometer. It is designed to be efficient and responsive.
